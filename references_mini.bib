Abstract = {{The application of Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to hierarchical data
   remains an open issue, because such data lack inherent quantitative
   information. Past studies have suggested binary encoding and
   Generalizing SOM as techniques that transform hierarchical data into
   numerical attributes. Based on graph theory, this paper puts forward a.
   novel approach that processes hierarchical data into a numerical
   representation for SOM-based clustering. The paper validates the
   proposed graph-theoretical approach via complexity theory and
   experiments on real-life data. The results suggest that the
   graph-theoretical approach has lower algorithmic complexity than
   Generalizing SOM, and can yield SOM having significantly higher cluster
   validity than binary encoding does. Thus, the graph-theoretical
   approach can form a data-preprocessing step that extends SOM to the
   domain of hierarchical data.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of huge data sets poses new problems to popular clustering
   and visualization algorithms such as neural gas (NG) and the
   self-organising-map (SOM) due to memory and time constraints. In such
   situations, it is no longer possible to store all data points in the
   main memory at once and only a few, ideally only one run over the whole
   data set is still affordable to achieve a feasible training time. In
   this contribution we propose single pass extensions of the classical
   clustering algorithms NG and SOM which are based on a simple patch
   decomposition of the data set and fast batch optimization schemes of
   the underlying cost function. The algorithms only require a fixed
   memory space. They maintain the benefits of the original ones including
   easy implementation and interpretation as well as large flexibility and
   adaptability. We demonstrate that parallelization of the methods
   becomes easily possible and we show the efficiency of the approach in a

Abstract = {{Clustering constitutes an ubiquitous problem when dealing with huge
   data sets for data compression, visualization, or preprocessing.
   Prototype-based neural methods such as neural gas or the
   self-organizing map offer an intuitive and fast variant which
   represents data by means of typical representatives, thereby running in
   linear time. Recently, an extension of these methods towards relational
   clustering has been proposed which can handle general non-vectorial
   data characterized by dissimilarities only, such as alignment or
   general kernels. This extension, relational neural gas, is directly
   applicable in important domains such as bioinformatics or text
   clustering. However, it is quadratic in m both in memory and in time (m
   being the number of data points). Hence, it is infeasible for huge data
   sets. In this contribution we introduce an approximate patch version of
   relational neural gas which relies on the same cost function but it
   dramatically reduces time and memory requirements. It offers a single
   pass clustering algorithm for huge data sets, running in constant space
   and linear time only.}},

Abstract = {{The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It
   is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in
   industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most
   extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the
   management of massive textual data bases. The SOM is related to the
   classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in
   digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ the SOM
   represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of
   models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated
   with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an
   ordered fashion such that more similar models become automatically
   associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less
   similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid.
   This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it
   possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of
   data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items
   belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can
   be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then
   classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar
   with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new
   finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more
   accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching
   models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure
   where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained
   to nonnegative values.}},

Abstract = {{Large graphs are natural mathematical models for describing the
   structure of the data in a wide variety of fields, such as web mining,

   problem. In particular, discovering groups of tightly connected
   vertices and understanding the relations between those groups is very
   important in practice. This paper shows how a kernel version of the
   batch self-organizing map can be used to achieve these goals via
   kernels derived from the Laplacian matrix of the graph, especially when
   it is used in conjunction with more classical methods based on the
   spectral analysis of the graph. The proposed method is used to explore
   the structure of a medieval social network modelled through a weighted
   graph that has been directly built from a large corpus of agrarian

Abstract = {{Neural gas (NG) constitutes a very robust clustering algorithm which
   can be derived as stochastic gradient descent from a cost function
   closely connected to the quantization error. In the limit, an NG
   network samples the underlying data distribution. Thereby, the
   connection is not linear, rather, it follows a power law with
   magnification exponent different from the information theoretically
   optimum one in adaptive map formation. There exists a couple of schemes
   to explicitly control the exponent such as local learning which leads
   to a small change of the learning algorithm of NG. Batch NG constitutes
   a fast alternative optimization scheme for NG vector quantizers which
   has been derived from the same cost function and which constitutes a
   fast Newton optimization scheme. It possesses the same magnification
   factor (different from 1) as standard online NG. In this paper, we
   propose a method to integrate magnification control by local learning
   into batch NG. Thereby, the key observation is a link of local learning
   to an underlying cost function which opens the way towards alternative,
   e.g. batch optimization schemes. We validate the learning rule derived
   from this altered cost function in an artificial experimental setting
   and we demonstrate the benefit of magnification control to sample rare
   events for a real data set. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing structure-function relationships on the proteomic scale is
   a unique challenge faced by bioinformatics and molecular biosciences.
   Large protein families represent natural libraries of analogues of a
   given catalytic or protein function, thus making them ideal targets for
   the investigation of structure-function relationships in proteins. To
   this end, we have developed a new technique for analyzing large amounts
   of detailed molecular structure information focusing on the functional
   centers of homologous proteins. Our approach uses unsupervised machine
   learning, in particular, self-organizing maps. The information captured
   by a self-organizing map and stored in its reference models highlights
   the essential structure of the proteins under investigation and can be
   effectively used to study detailed structural differences and
   similarities among homologous proteins. Our preliminary results
   obtained with a prototype based on these techniques demonstrate that we
   can classify proteins and identify common and unique structures within
   a family and, more importantly, identify common and unique structural
   features of different conformations of the same protein. The approach
   developed here outperforms many of today's structure analysis tools.
   These tools are usually either limited by the number of proteins they
   can process at the same time or they are limited by the structural
   resolution they can accommodate, that is, many of the structural
   analysis tools that can handle multiple proteins at the same time limit
   themselves to secondary structure analysis and therefore miss fine
   structural nuances within proteins. It is worthwhile noting that the
   ability of our approach to analyze different conformations of the same
   protein is beyond the capabilities of multiple residue sequence
   alignment techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In many real-world applications, data cannot be accurately represented
   by vectors. In those situations, one possible solution is to rely on
   dissimilarity measures that enable a sensible comparison between
   observations.
   Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) has been adapted to data described
   only through their dissimilarity matrix. This algorithm provides both
   nonlinear projection and clustering of nonvector data. Unfortunately,
   the algorithm suffers from a high cost that makes it quite difficult to
   use with voluntinous data sets. In this paper, we propose a new
   algorithm that provides an important reduction in the theoretical cost
   of the dissimilarity SOM without changing its outcome (the results are
   exactly the same as those obtained with the original algorithm).
   Moreover, we introduce implementation methods that result in very short
   running times.
   Improvements deduced from the theoretical cost model are validated on
   simulated and real-world data (a word list clustering problem). We also
   demonstrate that the proposed implementation methods reduce the running
   time of the fast algorithm by a factor up to three over a standard
   implementation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to validate the use of transcriptional
   profiling as a means of characterizing the complex interactions of the
   thousands of genes that are expressed during fracture healing. Standard
   mid-diaphyseal tibia fractures were generated in C57/B6 murine tibiae
   and the transcriptional expression of similar to 13,000 genes was
   assessed. Three time points after fracture were assessed: day 3,
   representative of the inflammatory phase; day 10, representative of the
   peak of cartilage formation; and day 21, representative of the period
   of primary bone formation and coupled remodeling. A self-organizing
   mapping approach of the data revealed the temporal relationships
   between the expression of mRNAs for extracellular matrix proteins and
   the proteases that degrade the proteoglycan and collagenous matrices. A
   broad group of extracellular matrix protein mRNAs representative of
   basement membranes, blood vessels and cartilage all showed elevated
   expression over the first 21 days of fracture healing. The sorting of
   the data identified an orderly temporal expression of the
   metalloproteinases and ADAMTS during the progression of fracture
   healing with (MMP2/MMP14/TIMP2) and ADAMTS4 and 15 preceding the
   expression of (MMP9/MMP13). Based on their patterns of expression,
   relative to the known activities of the encoded proteolytic enzymes,
   our results suggest that the dissolution of cartilage protoeglycans
   proceeds before the underlying collagenous components of the matrix are
   removed. The exclusion of several mRNAs that are normally expressed by
   osteoclasts in the profiles of mRNAs from days 3 and 10 suggests that
   osteoclastic activity was largely absent during the early periods of
   cartilage tissue formation and that proteoglycan and specific
   collagenase activities, precedes or is prerequisite to later osteoclast
   infiltration into the remodeling tissues. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{About eight percent of the human genome consists of human endogenous
   retrovirus sequences. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) are remains
   from ancient infections by retroviruses. The HERVs are mutated and
   deficient, but they still may give rise to transcripts or may affect
   the expression of human genes. The HERVs stem from several kinds of
   retroviruses. The,possible current functioning of the HERV sequences
   may reflect the origin of the HERVs. Hence, the classification of the
   diverse HERV sequences is a natural starting point when investigating
   the effect of HERVs in humans. The current HERV taxonomy is incomplete:
   some sequences cannot be assigned to any class and the classification
   is ambiguous for others. A Median Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a SOM for
   data about pairwise distances between samples, can be used to group all
   the HERVs found in the human genome. It visualizes the collection of
   3661 HERV sequences found by the RetroTector system, on a
   two-dimensional display that represents similarity relationships
   between individual sequences, as well as cluster structures and
   similarities of clusters. The SOM, as any dimensionality reduction
   method, necessarily has to make compromises when representing the data.
   In this work we extend the visualizations by bootstrap-based estimates
   on which parts of the visualization are reliable and which not, and use
   the SOM to find potentially new HERV groups.}},

   relationships of existing HERV families and detect potentially new HERV
   families. A Median Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a SOM for non-vectorial
   data, is used to group and visualize a collection of 3661 HERVs. The
   SOM-based analysis is complemented with estimates of the reliability of
   the results. A novel trustworthiness visualization method is used to
   estimate which parts of the SOM visualization are reliable and which
   not. The reliability of extracted interesting HERV groups is verified
   by a bootstrap procedure suitable for SOM visualization-based analysis.
   The SOM detects a group of epsilonretroviral sequences and a group of
   ERV9, HERVW, and HUERSP3 sequences which suggests that ERN79 and HERVW
   sequences may have a common origin.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering problems arise in various domains of science and
   engineering. A large number of methods have been developed to date.
   Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) is a popular tool that maps a
   high-dimensional space onto a small number of dimensions by placing
   similar elements close together, forming clusters. Cluster analysis is
   often left to the user. In this paper we present a method and a set of
   tools to perform unsupervised SOM cluster analysis, determine cluster
   confidence and visualize the result as a tree facilitating comparison
   with existing hierarchical classifiers. We also introduce a distance
   measure for cluster trees that allows to select a SOM with the most
   confident clusters.}},

Abstract = {{One of the limiting factors in deciphering transcriptional regulatory
   networks is the effectiveness of motif-finding software. An emerging
   avenue for improving motif-finding accuracy aims to incorporate
   generalized binding constraints of related transcription factors (TFs),
   named familial binding profiles (FBPs), as priors in motif
   identification methods. A motif-finder can thus be `biased' towards
   finding motifs from a particular TF family. However, current
   motif-finders allow only a single FBP to be used as a prior in a given
   motif-finding run. In addition, current FBP construction methods are
   based on manual clustering of position specific scoring matrices
   (PSSMs) according to the known structural properties of the TF
   proteins. Manual clustering assumes that the binding preferences of
   structurally similar TFs will also be similar. This assumption is not
   true, at least not for some TF families. Automatic PSSM clustering
   methods are thus required for augmenting the usefulness of FBPs.
   Results: A novel method is developed for automatic clustering of PSSM
   models. The resulting FBPs are incorporated into the SOMBRERO
   motif-finder, significantly improving its performance when finding
   motifs related to those that have been incorporated. SOMBRERO is thus
   the only existing de novo motif-finder that can incorporate knowledge
   of all known PSSMs in a given motif-finding run.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: The automatic identification of over-represented motifs
   present in a collection of sequences continues to be a challenging
   problem in computational biology. In this paper, we propose a
   self-organizing map of position weight matrices as an alternative
   method for motif discovery. The advantage of this approach is that it
   can be used to simultaneously characterize every feature present in the
   dataset, thus lessening the chance that weaker signals will be missed.
   Features identified are ranked in terms of over-representation relative
   to a background model.
   Results: We present an implementation of this approach, named SOMBRERO
   (self-organizing map for biological regulatory element recognition and
   ordering), which is capable of discovering multiple distinct motifs
   present in a single dataset. Demonstrated here are the advantages of
   our approach on various datasets and SOMBRERO's improved performance
   over two popular motif-finding programs, MEME and AlignACE.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing prevalence of obesity is considered to be a major public
   health problem, particularly in the United States {[}6,22]. Many
   factors have been considered in causing this unhealthy condition, but
   an overall aging population could be a dominant cause, as it is well
   known that most people gain weight as they age. However, when the US
   population is analyzed as generational cohorts (based on year of
   birth), not simply as age cohorts growing older each year, some
   different patterns emerge. Trends based on age cohorts and generational
   cohorts are compared with geography (state) as a controlling factor. As
   trends in population weight can serve as a general health status
   ``signal,{''} a wavelet-based approach to analysis was selected, using
   Haar wavelet coefficients as the Self-Organizing Map weight vectors.
   Similarity was determined by the Kullback-Leibler Information
   statistic. The result is that generations prior to the ``Baby
   Boomer{''} generation, who were not exposed to more recent unhealthy
   food consumption patterns as younger people, are less likely to be
   obese, in spite of their age. In addition, geography also plays a role.
   Understanding behavioral and attitudinal factors in obesity could lead
   to more targeted and effective public health campaigns.}},

   important models recently proposed in literature, to investigate

   investigate theoretical properties of the models in detail: we
   explicitly formalize how structures are internally stored in different
   context models and which similarity measures are induced by the
   recursive mapping onto the structures. We assess the representational
   capabilities of the models, and we shortly discuss the issues of
   topology preservation and noise tolerance. The models are compared in
   an experiment with time series data. Finally, we add an experiment for
   one context model for tree-structured data to demonstrate the
   capability to process complex structures. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All
